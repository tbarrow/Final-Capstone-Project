Whereas in recent decades the Rohingya people have lost, through systematic   discrimination by Burmese national, state, and local authorities, a   range of civil and political rights, including citizenship, and face   barriers today such that they have been rendered stateless; Whereas the Burmese military and security forces have committed numerous crimes   against civilians over many years in Burma's Rakhine, Shan, Kachin, and   Karen States; Whereas beginning August 25, 2017, the Burmese military and security forces, as   well as civilian mobs, carried out widespread attacks, rapes, killings,   and the burning of villages throughout Rakhine State resulting in   approximately 730,000 Rohingya fleeing to Bangladesh and bringing the   total Rohingya refugee population in Cox's Bazar to over 900,000; Whereas on November 14, 2018, Vice President Mike Pence said, ``This is a   tragedy that has touched the hearts of millions of Americans. The   violence and persecution by military and vigilantes that resulted in   driving 700,000 Rohingya to Bangladesh is without excuse.''; Whereas to date, though the refugee crisis is not of their making, the   Government of Bangladesh has generously accommodated the rapid and   massive influx of Rohingya refugees into Cox's Bazar; Whereas the Government of Bangladesh continues to express concern about the lack   of accountability for the perpetrators of these crimes and the need to   find durable solutions; Whereas in June 2018, it was announced that the United Nations and the   Government of Burma had reached an agreement for the ``voluntary, safe,   dignified and sustainable'' return of Rohinyga to Burma; Whereas that agreement was contingent upon the provision of unimpeded access to   northern Rakhine by United Nations High Commission on Refugees (UNHCR)   and United Nations Development Program (UNDP) in order to verify the   necessary conditions on the ground for such voluntary, safe, dignified,   and sustainable returns; Whereas Burma's civilian government, led by State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi   and President Win Myint, has not yet taken the necessary steps to   address the violence directed against the Rohingya and has failed to   create the necessary conditions for returns, including by actively   impeding access to northern Rakhine by UNHCR, UNDP, humanitarian   organizations, and journalists; Whereas on August 24, 2018, the United Nations International Fact Finding   Mission on Myanmar released a preliminary report stating that, ``The   Mission concluded . . . that there is sufficient information to warrant   the investigation and prosecution of senior officials in the Tatmadaw   chain of command, so that a competent court can determine their   liability for genocide in relation to the situation in Rakhine State.''; Whereas on August 25, 2018, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said ``A year ago,   following deadly militant attacks, security forces responded by   launching abhorrent ethnic cleansing of ethnic Rohingya in Burma'', and   continued ``The U.S. will continue to hold those responsible   accountable. The military must respect human rights for Burma's   democracy to succeed.''; Whereas the Department of the Treasury announced sanctions on five Tatmadaw   officers and two Tatmadaw units for human rights abuses in Rakhine,   Kachin, and Shan States; Whereas on September 24, 2018, the Department of State released a report   entitled ``Documentation of Atrocities in Northern Rakhine State'' that   stated the military ``targeted civilians indiscriminately and often with   extreme brutality'' and that the violence in northern Rakhine State was   ``extreme, large-scale, widespread and seemingly geared toward both   terrorizing the population and driving gout the Rohingya residents'' and   that the ``scope and scale of the military's operations indicate that   they were well-planned and coordinated'': Whereas Reuters, a highly respected worldwide news organization, discovered   evidence of mass murder in the village of Inn Din as part of its ongoing   reporting on the Burmese military's campaign against the Rohingya, and   deployed journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo to fact-check and interview   eyewitnesses to these and other events; Whereas on December 12, 2017, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were arrested by Burmese   security forces in a suburb of Yangon and remain in custody to date; Whereas on April 20, 2018, a key witness for the prosecution, Police Captain Moe   Yan Naing, testified that he was ordered by his superiors to ``trap'' Wa   Lone; Whereas on September 3, 2018, Yangon Northern District Judge Ye Lwin ruled that   Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo breached the colonial-era Official Secrets Act   during their investigation into the massacre in Inn Din and subsequently   sentenced them each to 7 years in prison with hard labor, despite   admissions by the police under oath in court that the documents in   question were planted with the journalists as a front for their arrest; Whereas United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with Burma's Foreign   Minister, Kyaw Tin, at the ASEAN Foreign Ministers' Meeting in August   2018 and called for the immediate release of Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo; Whereas on September 4, 2018, Vice President Mike Pence stated, ``Wa Lone & Kyaw   Soe Oo should be commended--not imprisoned--for their work exposing   human rights violations [and] mass killings. Freedom of religion [and]   freedom of the press are essential to a strong democracy.''; Whereas Members of Congress, professional journalist organizations, human rights   groups, and other distinguished leaders from around the world have   called on the Burmese authorities to release Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo   from their unjust imprisonment; and Whereas the United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the   Crime of Genocide, signed at Paris December 9, 1948 declares that   ``means any of the following acts committed with the intent to destroy,   in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as   such: (a) Killing members of the group; (b) Causing serious bodily or   mental harm to members of the group; (c) Deliberately inflicting on the   group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical   destruction in whole or in part; (d) Imposing measures intended to   prevent births within the group; (e) Forcibly transferring children of   the group to another group'' and ``The following acts shall be   punishable: (a) Genocide; (b) Conspiracy to commit genocide; (c) Direct   and public incitement to commit genocide; (d) Attempt to commit   genocide; (e) Complicity in genocide.'': Now, therefore, be it     Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that--      (1) the atrocities committed against the Rohingya by the Burmese   military and security forces since August 2017 constitute crimes against   humanity and genocide;      (2) the Secretary of State should--       (A) determine, based on available evidence, whether the    actions by the Burmese military in northern Rakhine State in    2017 constitute crimes against humanity, genocide, or other    crimes under international law; and       (B) fully support efforts to collect, preserve, and make    available evidence related to the commission of these crimes;      (3) all those responsible for these crimes against humanity and   genocide should be tracked, sanctioned, arrested, prosecuted, and   punished under applicable international criminal statutes and   conventions;      (4) every Government and multinational body should call such   atrocities by their rightful names of ``crimes against humanity'', ``war   crimes'', and ``genocide'';      (5) the Governments of Bangladesh, the United States, and China, as   well as the UNHCR and other actors, should only support repatriations to   Burma when the conditions for safe, voluntary and dignified returns are   achieved, including that of removing any impunity for Burma's military,   security forces, and vigilantes with respect to their actions   contributing to the systemic deprivation of the human rights, such as   physical safety, citizenship, freedom of movement, and livelihoods, of   the Rohingya;      (6) the President should impose additional sanctions on senior   members of the Burmese military and security forces who are responsible   for genocide and human rights abuses, including Tatmadaw Commander-In-  Chief Min Aung Hliang;      (7) independent and professional journalism play a central role in   strengthening democratic governance, upholding the rule of law,   mitigating conflict, and informing public opinion around the world; and      (8) the Burmese military and Government should--       (A) provide immediate, unimpeded access to northern Rakhine    by UNHCR, UNDP, other humanitarian actors, and journalists, in    order to verify that the necessary conditions exist for    voluntary, safe, dignified, and sustainable returns by displaced    Rohingya in a manner consistent with internationally recognized    human rights and principles for refugee protection;       (B) change the laws and policies that have contributed to    insecurity in the Rakhine State; and       (C) rescind any laws that obstruct the freedom of the press;    and      (9) State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi and President Win Myint should   pardon and immediately release from prison Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, as   well as all other journalists and political prisoners.
